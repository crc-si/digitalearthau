    "## About Landsats\n",
    "\n",
    "At over 40 years, the Landsat series of satellites provides the longest temporal record of moderate resolution multispectral data of the Earth's surface on a global basis. The Landsat record has remained remarkably unbroken, proving a unique resource to assist a broad range of specialists in managing the world's food, water, forests, and other natural resources for a growing world population.  It is a record unmatched in quality, detail, coverage, and value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Landsat represents the world's longest continuously acquired collection of space-based moderate-resolution land remote sensing data. Four decades of imagery provides a unique resource for those who work in agriculture, geology, forestry, regional planning, education, mapping, and global change research. Landsat images are also invaluable for emergency response and disaster relief.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a joint initiative between the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and NASA, the Landsat Project and the data it collects support government, commercial, industrial, civilian, military, and educational communities throughout the United States and worldwide.\n",

    "In the mid-1960s an ambitious effort to develop and launch the first civilian Earth observation satellite was started. The goal was achieved on July 23, 1972, with the launch of the Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS-1), which was later renamed Landsat 1. The launches of Landsat 2, Landsat 3, and Landsat 4 followed in 1975, 1978, and 1982, respectively.\n",

    "\n",
    "Landsat 7 was successfully launched in 1999 and, along with Landsat 8, launched in 2013, continues to provide daily global data. Landsat 9 is planned to be launched in late 2020.\n",

    "## Basic facts that apply to all\n",
    "\n",
    "All these satellites orbit over the polar regions, and take 98.9 minutes to complete one cycle around the Earth at a speed of 7.5 km per sec. It means there will be 14.56 cycles per day. The orbit is inclined at 98.2&deg; and, therefore, each cycle moves the path to the East at a rate equal to the rotation of Earth (\"sun-synchronous\"). Therefore, the clock time it passes a point on the Earth's surface remains the same in every cycle. For Landsat 5 it was 9:45am +/- 15 minutes when it passes over the equator, and for Landsats 7 and 8 it is 10am +/- 15 minutes. (*Question: Not sure why the +/- 15 variability. How does it correct over subsequent passes? If the Sun shows the same variability, we will be in big trouble!*). The satellites cover the entire face of Earth in 16 days, as explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The \"Swath\"\n",
    "Everytime it passes over Earth, the sateliites scan the surface as a band of 185km in width, which is called **swath**. The equatorial circumference of Earth is 40,075 km and therefore a band of 172 km is required to cover the entire surface in 16 days at 14.56 cycles per day (40,075 / (16 * 14.56) = 172). A swath of 185 km means that there will be an overlap of 7.3&deg; (172 + 7.3% = 184.56) at the equator, and increasing overlaps moving towards North and South. Fig 2 below shows how the swath pattern looks like over North America.\n",

    "### \"Rows\",  \"Paths\" and \"Scenes\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the satellite is passing in a N-S direction, and the inclination makes it move Eastwards, there are two kinds of coverage. The North-South (or vice versa; \"vertical\") coverage is called **Row** and West to East coverage is called **Path** (\"horizontal\"). Let us examine below what these mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **row** maybe defined as the surface distance covered in 23.92 seconds of the satellite's motion in the vertical direction. The polar circumference of the Earth is 39,931 km and the satellite covers it in 98.9 min. Thus, in 23.92 seconds the satellite will cover 161 km (39,931/(98.9\\*60) * 23.92 = 160.96) in either direction. Hence, there will be **248 rows per day** (39931/161 = 248).\n",
    "\n",
    "The rows have been assigned in such a way that Row 60 coincides with the Equator (descending node). Row 1 of each path starts at 80째 46' N and the numbering increases southward to latitude 81째 51' S (Row 122). Then, beginning with Row 123, the row numbers ascend northward, cross the Equator (Row 184) and continue to latitude 81째 51' N (Row 246). Row 248 is located at latitude 81째 21' N, whereupon the next path begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **path** is defined as the width of swath, which is 172 km at the equator (allowing for the overlap of 7.3% with the actual width of 185 km) and there will be 233 paths to cover the entire surface (40,075 / 172 = 232.99). Hence, there will be **233 paths per 16 days**, the time it takes to cover the full surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **scene** is a composite picture captured in 23.92 seconds, as the satellite passes over. Now that we know that the swath is 185 km and row is 161 km, the dimensions of each scene will be 185 x 161 km. Also, there can be a total of 57,784 possible scenes (248 rows * 233 paths) to be captured in a 16-day cycle. The actual number of scenes captured (\"acquisitions\") is much less that this, and we shall see about it below.\n"

    "### Acquisitions \n",
    "\n",
    "Even though there are 57,784 possible scenes in 16 days (or 3,612 per day) the number of acquisitions by landsat 7 averages around 450 per day, and that by landsat 8 averages around 650 per day ([Ref](https://landsat.usgs.gov/landsat-7-data-users-handbook-section-1)). \n",
    "\n",
    "The ETM+ sensor does not continually acquire imagery data as it orbits the Earth. Instead, acquisitions are scheduled in advance using the Landsat 7 Long Term Acquisition Plan (LTAP), data files in conjunction with a software scheduler. The scheduler automatically selects the best scenes in accordance with the LTAP, basing these decisions on cloud-cover forecasts, urgency of acquisition, and availability of resources to optimize fulfillment of the overall Landsat 7 mission goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Acquisitions are also limited by physical constraints of the instrument. Cloud avoidance is a major factor in the selection of the scenes rejected. The benefits of this acquisition strategy are an increase in the number of scenes that can be acquired, along with a reduction in instrument duty cycle and the number of power cycles required. The goal is to acquire more images with more frequent revisits over the continental land masses without increasing risk to the mission.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The factors that are considered during scheduling are:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-\tSeasonality of vegetated regions, as well as niche-science communities with specific acquisition needs\n",
    "-\tPredicted vs. nominal cloud-cover (forecast vs. statistical assessments)\n",
    "-\tSolar elevation angle (especially important at high latitudes)\n",
    "-\tMissed opportunities for previous acquisitions\n",
    "-\tQuality (based on cloud-cover assessments) of previous acquisitions\n",
    "-\tScene clustering (for continuity of swath observations)\n",
    "-\tSystem constraints (e.g., instrument duty cycle, ground station locations and functionality, recorder capacity)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Also, niche communities initially sponsored the following locations and associated time windows:**\n",
    "\n",
    "-\t282 agriculture areas (acquire every season if cloud cover predict < 60%)\n",
    "-\t35 calibration sites (acquire \"always\")\n",
    "-\t896 reefs (acquire from 2x to 6x each year)\n",
    "-\t30 fire-impacted areas (acquire \"always\")\n",
    "-\t1392 land ice scenes other than Antarctica (acquire once during certain months)\n",
    "-\t3601 Antarctica scenes (acquire once during Jan-Feb)\n",
    "-\t60 oceanic islands (acquire twice each year)\n",
    "-\t1175 rainforest areas (acquire \"always\" all year)\n",
    "-\t352 sea ice scenes (acquire from 1x to 3x each year)\n",
    "-\t11 Siberia scenes (acquire \"always\" over 9 months)\n",
    "-\t72 volcanoes (acquire from 2x to 12x during year, including night)\n",
    "\n",
    "An acquisition request is granted a priority increase as a function of the number of consecutive past cycles in which the opportunity to acquire the requested scene was not fulfilled. For example, if the last successfully acquired image of a scene was 48 days ago, then a request for this scene is granted a priority increase based on two missed opportunities from 32 and 16 days ago. In addition, all new requests submitted when an acquisition window opens are also given a priority increase to help them compete with established requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the map below shows, the number of acquisitions vary between regions. The maximum number of a particular scene collected over a whole year is only 23, instead of the maximum possible 248 acquisitions. (*Question: How will it affect the data analysis? Apparently, less than 1 in 10 time points will have any data. Is that true?*)\n",
